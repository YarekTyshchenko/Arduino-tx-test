Ominus
======

The project is split into two parts

Transmitter
-----------

This is built with a Minimus32K Arduino compatible MCU, The sketch included endlessly transmits random colours.

Reciever
--------

The reciever is built with an Arduino Micro, but hopefully it will be replaced with just an ATMega328 and packaged in a box.
